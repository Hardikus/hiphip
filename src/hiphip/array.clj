(ns hiphip.array
  "Macros for iteration on generic arrays.  This namespace provides
   versions that can iterate over arbitrary mixtures of array types,
   but the arrays must be appropriately type hinted for good
   performance.  The specific array type namespaces (double/float/...)
   offer versions of these macros that do not require type hints, but
   only work on arrays of the corresponding type.

   All these macros use binding forms that look like:

   [[i x] xs
    y ys ...]

   This binds i to the index and x and y to the ith element of xs and
   ys, respectively. Note that unlike for/doseq, iteration over
   multiple arrays is parallel rather than nested.

   You can include index variables wherever and whenever you want, so
   you can do:

   [x xs
    y ys ...]

   or:

   [[i1 x] xs
    [i2 y] ys
    [i3 z] zs ...]

   but i1, i2, and i3 will have the same value.

   You can also include a range as a first element of the binding:

   [:range [0 10]
    [i x] xs]

   and the operation will only be applied over that range. The default
   range is from 0 to the length of the first array in the binding."
