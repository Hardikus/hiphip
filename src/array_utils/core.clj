;; # Core utils

;; A note on bindings: All these macros use binding forms that look like:
;;   [[i x] xs
;;    y ys ...]
;; This binds x and y to the ith element of xs and ys, respectively. You can
;; include i-variables wherever and whenever you want, so you can do:
;;   [x xs
;;    y ys ...]
;; or:
;;   [[i1 x] xs
;;    [i2 y] ys
;;    [i3 z] zs ...]
;; but i1 and i2 will have the same value.

;; All of these are internal tools that require type information as their first argument.
;; Refer to type_impl.clj, double.clj, long.clj et cetera for proper implementations.
