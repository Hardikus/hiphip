  "A note on bindings: All these macros use binding forms that look like:

  [[i x] xs
   y ys
   ...]

  This binds i to the index and x and y to the ith element of xs and ys,
  respectively. You can include index variables wherever and whenever you
  want, so you can do:

  [x xs
   y ys
   ...]

  or:

  [[i1 x] xs
   [i2 y] ys
   [i3 z] zs
   ...]

  but i1, i2, and i3 will have the same value.

  You can also include a range as a first element of the binding:

  [:range [0 10]
   [i x] xs]

  and the operation will only be applied over that range.

  All of these are internal tools that require type information as
  their first argument. Refer to type_impl.clj, double.clj, long.clj
  et cetera for proper implementations.")
